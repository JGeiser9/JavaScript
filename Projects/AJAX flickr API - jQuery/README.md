AJAX Flickr API :

The idea behind this project is a designer gives you a layout and idea of how they want the webpage to function. It is up to    you to link up to the Flickr public photos API. 

Stage 1:
 
In the first draft of this build, the layout is designed with 3 buttons. When any of the three buttons is clicked the 
click event will call a AJAX request to the flickr API to retrieve the latest 20 posts with the tag names in the 'animal' variable holding the text value of the button clicked. 

Stage 2: 

The second stage of the build will allow the user to type in an image they wish to search for. The form will be submited and the value of the search will be passed along to retrieve the most recent 20 posts on flickr with the tag matching the search input by the user.
