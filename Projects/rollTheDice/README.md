Object Oriented Programming :

  A very basic Javascript demonstration on how object oriented programming is used. 
  
    - A "dice" object is created to store a roll method which creates a random number.
    - When the button is clicked to "roll the dice" the .roll() method that was created generates a number
      and stores it in a variable.
    - The variable holding the random number is passed into a function designed to set the innerHTML of an element
      which in turn prints the random number or "roll of the dice" to the web page.
