Object Oriented Programing:

  This playlist project was created for the purpose of learning about Object Oriented Programing, Methods,
  Prototyping, and Constructor Functions on TeamTreehouse. The objective here is DRY and optimized code.
  
  When prototypes are used, instead of creating a method for each instance of an object, the prototype allows
  a single method to be shared accross all instances of an object.
