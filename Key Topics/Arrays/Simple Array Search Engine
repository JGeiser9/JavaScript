// This project is designed to search an array of all current items in stock at a hockey store...since hockey is of course the 
// best sport out there. The program will prompt a user to search if hockey supplies are in stock. Depending on what the user
// types it will respond if they are or are not in stock. If the user types 'list' in the prompt every product currently in
// stock will print out separated by a comma. If the user types 'quit' or cancels the prompt the loop with end. The while loop
// will continue to prompt the user until they quit or cancel the prompt.
