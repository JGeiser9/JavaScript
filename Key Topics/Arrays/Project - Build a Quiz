//Directions:
  //1. Use a 2D array to hold the questions and answers.
  //2. Each element of the array is one question.
  //3. Use a loop to cycle through the 3 quiz questions, ask it using the prompt method, and compare the response.
  //4. Conditional statement to compare the response.
  //5. When the loop is done - count how many were right and wrong.
  //   ** MUST BE A DIV IN THE HTML WITH AN ID = OUTPUT IN ORDER TO WORK **
